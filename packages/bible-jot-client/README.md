# Bible Jot Client

This package contains the client-side application for Bible Jot.

Currently, all Bible data is stored locally on the device, and there is no API integration. This allows for the Bible content to be freely hosted and delivered to devices, as all the bible data used in the app is in the public domain.

## Current Features

- **Local Data Storage**: All Bible data is stored on the user's device, ensuring a fast and private experience.
- **Public Domain Bible Content**: Since the Bible text is in the public domain, we can host and deliver it for free without the need for paid licenses or cloud storage.
- **No API Integration**: The app operates entirely offline, with no need for an external server or cloud-based service.

## Future Plans

In the future, if there is demand for cloud storage or access to paid Bible versions, an API will be developed to enable these features. This will allow users to sync their notes, access premium Bible translations, and enjoy other cloud-based functionalities.
